PowerChordPHP: For when you ain't writing a symphony.
=========================================================
...cut out the middleman, plug in, and rock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features:
### Rapid and Flexible Development
Solves the main annoyance the PHP framework's pseudo MVC structure by implementing a "DataGate" object to extend. This allows you to send superglobal data to and from Models directly in the view, skipping the controller entirely.
**The DataGate object answers the question: _Where the heck do I put this method?_**

### Made for the SQlite PDO driver and only the SQlite PDO driver out of the box
Wait, how is this a feature? PowerChordPHP comes with a powerchord.sqlite database ready to use all you need do is extend the model class.
 _You're too Rock 'n' Roll to worry about connecting to a database. You've got a Model to do that dirty work for you!_
**Download the SQLite Manager add-on for Firefox, create some tables, extend the Model class, and jam!**

### Portable, like a guitar on your back
You can copy your project directory and plop it down anywhere thanks to SQLite. If you're hosting company pisses you off, pick up your directory and go.
**Focus on your PHP, javascript, and style. Churn out code like the Beatles churned out hits.**
